# Validation data
Images of 792 (20%) were selected from dataset-3960 as the validation data in our paper. We also provide the weight file of the YOLO-Tpest model, You can find detection results using YOLO-Tpest model here.

# Training data
dataset-3960 contains 860 sugarcane aphid (SCA) images from sorghum, 1400 wheat mite (WM) and 1000 wheat aphid (WA) images from wheat, and 700 rice planthopper (RP) images from rice were obtained.
The SCA images were collected by the authors on a 40,000 square meter farm at Texas A&M AgriLife Research Center. You can find 860 sugarcane aphid (SCA) images here.
The images of the other three pests are from the public AgriPest dataset. For reference, the AgriPest dataset can be accessed at the following URL: https://github.com/liuliu66/AgriPest. You can also refer to the author's published paper: Wang R, Liu L, Xie C, Yang P, Li R, Zhou M. 2021. AgriPest: A large-scale domain-specific benchmark dataset for practical agricultural pest detection in the wild. Sensors, 21, 1601-1615.
The dataset is divided into a ratio of 6:2:2.

# Evaluation metrics
The code of evaluation matrics in our paper was illustrated here, including mAP, Precision, Recall, and speed (FPS).

# Video of pest detection platform based on YOLO-Tpest model
A mobile terminal of 4 tiny pests image/video detection was built. You can find the DEMO video here.
